0x1: Gonna put this out here for those who do not understand.   I have been increasingly frustrated with how people use the word
"code".  The term "code" is extremely stupid when referring to text that makes something happen.  Its text.  JUST TEXT.  Alright?  

0x2: There are far better terms than just "code" or "source code".  Let me explain.

0x3: In a command line, you write *text* in either bash (linux) or (in windows) batch.  But its structured.  Which is why it
need to be called "source text" or "scripture".  This is comparing to ancient text documents like holy book scripture, such as
the bible, Quran, Tanakh, etc.  "Script" is too generic and used messively.

0x4: Unity makes use of the word "script" when referring to their C# scripture.  << Notice, I didnt use "code".

0x5: You will also notice "C#, C++, C, Rust, F#, JavaScript", etc.  THEY ARE ALL LANGUAGES like we speak daily!! It has *nothing*
to do with the word "code". Machine code should also refer to as "machine-read text".  Think of English, spanish, french, chinese?
All those are used in similar here!!

0x6: Encountering encryption, thats ALSO TEXT.  It would be best to use "scrambled algorithmic text".  NOT encryption.  Sorry!!

0x7: The reason I request the terms that this whole site uses to be changed is because it is confusing to me.  It nails down
to text.  

0x8: Hex, decimal? ASCII?  THEY ARE NOT CODE.  They are ways of "organizing said text" into a manner readable in base2 form.

0x9: Data types such as char, int, long, DWORD, SWORD (24 bit int).  They are ALL DATATYPES.  Also known as "organized datatypes".

0xa: End of discussion.
